1) Exploring the data
2) Cleaning the data set
 
   i) Identifying missing values

   ii) Removing Nan values 

   iii)Remove unwanted columns 

   iv) Converting Categorical values to Numerical
3) Visualise data features with target values and observing important points

    i) Comparision of Purchase amount with Category_1

    -----> 6, 7, 10 are highest brought products
    
    -----> 19, 20 are least brought products
    
    ii) Comparistion of purchase amount with Occupation

    -----> We can observe that almost all occupation purchase equally
    
4)Scaling the data before giving to model
